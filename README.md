PyKiCad
=======

This is a Python library meant to generate and parse KiCad produced files, such as KiCad Boards, Module Library, ...

The library is in an early stage where it can create KiCad modue library version 2 only, and restricted to Silkscreen drawing.

Yet, this is enough to draw logos and other things for PCBs, and it is used by SVG2KiCad tools (see [kicad-utils](https://github.com/cjlano/kicad-utils))

Enjoy :-)
